  <h1>Legion of Beasts: Rise of the Roman Vanguard</h1>

  <p>In an age long forgotten, the mighty Roman Empire has expanded across vast lands, forging order from chaos. Yet, even at the height of its glory, the Empire faces threats beyond its borders—dark lands teeming with wild beasts, unknown magic, and barbaric warbands. To protect the realm and claim new territories, the Senate has established a bold new initiative: <strong>The Vanguard Legion</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>You are one of the newest recruits.</strong></p>

  <h2>The Training Ground (Creative World)</h2>
  <p>Within the fortified academy walls of the Roman capital, recruits begin their journey. Here, in the <strong>Training Ground</strong>, soldiers are given unrestricted access to tools, materials, and ancient knowledge. This is a place of learning, invention, and camaraderie. You will hone your skills, forge your first weapons, and build war machines—all under the watchful eyes of seasoned commanders.</p>
  <blockquote>"Here, you are safe to fail. Out there, failure is death."</blockquote>

  <h2>The Empire Proper (Peaceful Mode)</h2>
  <p>Once deemed ready, recruits are stationed within the <strong>heart of the Empire</strong>. These are fertile lands of marble cities, aqueducts, and bustling trade—where law reigns and conflict is rare. But even in peace, duty calls. You’ll maintain infrastructure, help defend against minor threats, and prepare for the call to war. This is where you earn your insignia.</p>
  <blockquote>“Peace is the reward of strength—but it must be guarded.”</blockquote>

  <h2>The Proving Grounds (Hardcore Mode)</h2>
  <p>Beyond the outer walls lies the <strong>Frontier</strong>, a land known only as the <strong>Proving Grounds</strong>. It is here that recruits become true legionnaires—or perish. Death is permanent, and survival means glory. You’ll face harsh wilderness, cunning enemies, and the unknown. Every outpost built, every beast slain, every decision made—matters.</p>
  <blockquote>“This is no longer training. This is war.”</blockquote>

  <hr />
  <p><strong>Your mission:</strong><br>
  Train. Serve. Conquer.<br>
  Only the worthy will rise through the ranks and etch their name into the Empire’s history.</p>
