# render_controllers

**Path:** `packs/resource_packs/lob_base/render_controllers`

Render controller JSONs for Bedrock. Commit files; binds materials/textures to geometry.

## Rules
- Keep this directory purpose-specific as described above.
- Follow repo policy: source-only in Git; generated artifacts are ignored.
- See top-level docs: `docs/minecraft_tool_chain.md` for the full workflow.
