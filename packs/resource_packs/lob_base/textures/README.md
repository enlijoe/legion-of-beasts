# textures

**Path:** `packs/resource_packs/lob_base/textures`

PNG textures used by models/entities/blocks. Commit textures; reference them from materials and render controllers.

## Rules
- Keep this directory purpose-specific as described above.
- Follow repo policy: source-only in Git; generated artifacts are ignored.
- See top-level docs: `docs/minecraft_tool_chain.md` for the full workflow.
