# models

**Path:** `packs/resource_packs/lob_base/models`

Generated .glb models go here at build time. Do not commit .glb; source lives in assets/blender/src. Mounted into the Bedrock resource pack.

## Rules
- Keep this directory purpose-specific as described above.
- Follow repo policy: source-only in Git; generated artifacts are ignored.
- See top-level docs: `docs/minecraft_tool_chain.md` for the full workflow.
